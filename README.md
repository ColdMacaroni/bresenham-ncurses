# Bresenham's line algorithm
A simple implementation in C, wanted to see how it worked.
To compile just run `make`. You need the ncurses library. curses might work as well just delete the extra include, it was generated by clangd and I forgot to delete it.

Click twice to select the start and end, then press any key to see the line generate.
